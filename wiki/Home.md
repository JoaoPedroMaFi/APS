# **FOODSAVING**

The project purpose is the development of a software solution, but it will focus on the activities of software analysis and software design.

The project will consist of an app or platform that helps reduce food waste by controlling the shelf life of products present in markets, and notifying the various stakeholders of the approaching of the end of life of such products. By doing so, everyone will save in resources, which are finite in our world, and money, which everyone likes to save as well.
