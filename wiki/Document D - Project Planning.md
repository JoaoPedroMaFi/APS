## **Technical architecture** ##

The functional components will all be hosted on the web app. The "User registration" and "User reservations" components need to accessible from anywhere, so it will be implemented as a web application using the most popular /cheap/easy tools to build it. The database will be synchronized with each of the foodchains that apply to the initiative, providing real-time information to the customer.

The main requirement for the "Food Saving Web App" component is to be easy to understand, fast and to be up/online any time, thus enabling two things: customers to make a reservation whenever they want, and also the first come first served system.




## **Product Backlog (PB) preparation** ##

In this project, the product backlog is made of a mixture of User stories, use Cases (UC) and use Case Slices (UCS), whatever fits best for each situation.



## **UC Prioritization** ##

The UC prioritization is the task of assigning the priority level to each item of the PB, ordering them by priority level, so the higher priority items are developed first. The MoSCoW technique, used here, uses 4 priority levels: Must, Should, Could and Would/Won't.



**UC1.01:**	User registration and Login		
Priority: Must


**UC2.01:**	Product reservation	        
Priority: Must


**UC1.02:**	Cancel product reservation	
Priority: Should


**UC1.03:**	List product acquisitions	
Priority: Should


**UC3.01:**     User account deletion           
Priority: Could
