# **A Vision Project** #


## **Problem description** ##

In the year of 2020, overshoot day fell in the month of August. This means that the resources that should have been used in a year in order to guarantee future generation sustainability were all used up by that month.

Part of this problem consists in excessively producing food products, that don't even end up being 
consumed/bought due to little demand, either because of the high prices that limit the number of consumers,
or simply because its shelf life expires!


Educating people towards less food wasting should be one of the focuses these days, but it's not. How many parties for example have you been in and saw no food waste there for example?


## **This causes 3 big problems:** ##

* Edible food will end up in the trash!
* Overshooting recomended consumption of the earth's natural resources, endangering future generation sustainability.
* Lack of education/sensibility by the people when it comes to food, they dont see it as something that took resources to make and distribute, nor do they see it as a resource itself.

## **Business goals and benefits** ##
Our app/platform is looking to fix this by:

* Having markets adhere to our application by registering products and shelf life there.

* Reducing food waste by allowing people with less possessions to purchase these products at a lower price, since end of shelf life is approaching. This is something relative for each product, example: canned foods end of life could be considered in a month, while yogurts could be a couple of days. 
Once such matters are sorted, our app will notify customers of products on their whish lists being avaliable.

* The products on their respective ends of life are donated to charity or social support institutions. Our app will notify charities when products are ready to be picked up.



## **Stakeholders description** ##

To develop a new system, we need to engage:

* The Markets (distribution chains): They win by selling more products.
* The consumer( ordinary people ): They win by saving money.
* Charities or social support institutions (institutions that work only with supports, not for profit): They win by getting more free products.

## **Actors** ##

The system will have tree actors:

* **Markets** — represents the chains of markets. Represents all markets, from hypermarkets to supermarkets. These are the ones that put products on the platform that are approaching their respective end of life.
* **Costumer** — represents all normal people who can register on the platform to purchase products close to their relative end of life, for a lower price!
* **Charity** — represents all non-profit institutions registered on the platform to receive products that expire on the products respective last days.
