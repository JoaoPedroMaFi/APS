# **Business processes modelling** #
The markets have controls on the validity of the products, and know when they reach the last week of shelf life. When this happens, the respective products are placed separately, to be sold at a lower price. 

From there it is registered on the platform that a certain product is available. 

Consumers who have the announced products on their wishlist will receive a notification, and will be able to either make a reservation for what they want to buy, or they can just go to the market and buy in person. 

If the products are still not sold this way, when they start approaching the last day of the expiration date, institutions/charities that are also registered on the platform will be notified of such products reaching the end of their shelf life, and being ready to pick up, thus preventing the products from being wasted!
